This guide offers step-by-step instructions on everything you need to know about starting the TruBudget application and being able to start developing.

## Developer Setup

We suggest using the [Developer Setup](./Developer-Setup) guide to start developing the application with Docker and Docker-Compose.

## Bare Metal Installation

The [bare metal installation](./bare-metal-installation) only applies if you can't use Docker, Docker-Compose or Kubernetes.
