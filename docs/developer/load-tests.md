# Load and stress tests

TruBudget uses load and stress tests to ensure the system's stability. Some tests are triggered automatically after a major release, others run on each push to the remote repository or get triggered manually. The automated testing strategy allows to regularly check the system minimal requirements and adjust them as needed. Furthermore, developer get detailed information about the system allowing to search for flaws i.e. bottlenecks.

There three types of load/stress tests:

- Stress test: Classic stress to bring the core part of the system (API/Blockchain) to their limits. Although the system capacities are entirely used, the system should not crash nor be unusable
- Smoke Tests: Smoke test are regular load test, configured for minimal load. They are used for sanity checks.
- Stability Test: The whole system and it's interconnecting services such as Email Service and Storage Service are tested. This test, in terms of requests and users per second, is set up similarly to the stress test.

TruBudget uses [k6](https://k6.io) to define and run load and stability tests. Tests can be run both locally and using Docker. We highly recommend using docker since the [provided script](https://github.com/openkfw/TruBudget/tree/master/api/loadtest/runTests.sh) spins up a complete test setup including Grafana and Influx.
However, if you choose to run the tests locally, `k6` needs to be installed. An optional Grafana and Influx instance are not required, but recommended in order to analyze the data generated by the tests.
