# Certificates

Copy your certificates to this folder. Two files are expected, both with _.pem_ extension.

In order to use certificates to establish secure HTTPS generate certificate and private key files in .pem format. Default names are **certificate.pem** and **privatekey.pem**.

If you want to use HTTPS and you have copied certificates you need to specify 2 environment variables for frontend Dockerfile:

`USE_SSL=ssl` _# USE_SSL has to be set to "ssl"_

`SSL_DOMAIN=localhost` _# SSL_DOMAIN is a name of domain where TruBudget is running, e.g. example.com_

Docker `ARG SSL_DOMAIN` has to be specified, because Dockerfile uses it as a name for directory where certs are copied to.
For example in docker-compose file build/args/ `SSL_DOMAIN: localhost`.

Ports **443** and **80** need to be open.

For development purposes, certificates can be generated by running this command in `frontend/certificates` folder:
```
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -new -nodes -x509 -days 3650 -keyout privatekey.pem -out certificate.pem
```

Depending on your browser and its version, these certificates might not be trusted. For example, to bypass a warning in Chrome browser, type `thisisunsafe` inside the browser.
